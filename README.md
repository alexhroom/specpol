# specpol
This package contains functions and algorithms for the 
approximation of operator spectra and analysis of spectral pollution, written for 
my masters' thesis (at https://github.com/alexhroom/thesis). 

It is functional as a software package (i.e. it is `pip` installable)
and the algorithms available give the expected answers, but it is
badly tested & inconsistently designed. At some point I would like to rewrite
it better (maybe using PYO3 for the algebraic heavy lifting) and make it
behave consistently so it works well as an actual package.
